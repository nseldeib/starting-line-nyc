  // a dedicated preview host. Next.js blocks cross-origin access to dev
  // resources (the HMR socket, chunks) by default, and with the socket blocked
  // the app never hydrates — the page renders as a server-rendered shell whose
  // controls do nothing, with NO console error. That looks like an unrelated
  // bug, which is why this line is an obvious-looking candidate for deletion
  // and must not be deleted. `**.` matches any subdomain depth, so it survives
  // a preview host being re-slugged. For a self-hosted or custom preview
  // domain, set CODEYAM_PREVIEW_HOSTS (comma-separated) in the `env` block of
  // `.codeyam/editor.json`. Dev-scoped by construction: `allowedDevOrigins` is
  // read only by the dev server, so it widens nothing in production.
